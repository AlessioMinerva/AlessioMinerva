 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Journey</h3></summary>
My interest in cloud computing and IT first sparked during lock-down. I was fascinated by the concept of virtualization and began to research the various cloud solutions available. The possibilities of cloud computing seemed limitless and I was eager to learn more. Since then, I have kept up-to-date with the latest trends in cloud technology and have built a strong understanding of the architecture and design of various cloud solutions. 
I have joined a AWS re/start program from where I have learned a great deal, particularly in the areas of networking, cybersecurity, Python, Linux and of course the cloud. I found the topics to be interesting, and they taught me about the different network protocols and services, as well as security measures to protect networks and systems. Additionally, I enjoyed learning about Python and Linux to create applications and automate tasks.
In addition to cloud technology, I'm very interested in cybersecurity, which is becoming increasingly important in today's digital world. I enjoy learning about new security trends, tools, and techniques.
